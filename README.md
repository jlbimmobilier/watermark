# Watermark

A script to add a watermark on a bunch of images.

## Use

Place all photos in the directory `sources`.

In a terminal:

```bash
cd /path/to/watermark
```

```bash
php index.php
```

Wait for the script to end then find your photos in `tagged`.

1. You can [batch resize](https://gist.github.com/spyesx/3e0d9c32a02f3753c2785ad8a1e7f2ab) your photos.
2. Use [Google Guetzli](https://gist.github.com/spyesx/7e143f0ae43a1ad5c09dff2b56a04efa) to compress your JPEGs.
